        You might be used to receiving instant keys, but to minimize the risk of detection, this bot generates keys more
        authentically and with lower risk. The process may take several minutes, but it reduces the chances of being
        banned or receiving invalid keys.

        Many bots that provide multiple keys instantly often do so from the same server and IP address, making them
        easily detectable by Hamster Kombat.

        Although we can’t eliminate risk completely, we’ve made every effort to generate keys with random timing and
        directly from the game using your own IP address. This approach makes it more challenging for Hamster Kombat to
        identify the generated keys.
